# Description
# 
# Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of 
# different moves the knight can perform.
#
# The knight can move to a square that is two squares horizontally and one 
# square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally 
# away from it. The complete move therefore looks like the letter L. Check 
# out the image below to see all valid moves for a knight piece that is placed 
# on one of the central squares.
